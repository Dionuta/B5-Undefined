<h1>Notes</h1>

'Undefined' is a special value in JavaScript meaning the variable has not been set. In the initial phase of the execution context, all variables that have not been assigned are set to undefined. Undefined is a value unlike 'not defined.' 'Not defined' means during the execution the variable or function was not found in memory.
